[done] 1. test "call a subprocess, and update a DB when subprocess returns"
  (start with `sleep 10`)

2. put correct caffe calls in subprocess.call commands

3. set up "caffe trains for 5k iter... if above a threshold, then continue."
  -> do this w/ multiple solver.prototxts?
  -> or, do this by adding a stopping condition in Caffe C++ code?
